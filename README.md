# scrumy-trello

This is a work in progress. I've been using Trello for quite some time and want to add better support for SCRUM-based project management by adding tools for planning iterations, burn-down charts, and visualizing the progress of epics and features.  The functionality will be influenced with concepts from the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) from Scaled Agile, Inc.
